          In Ethiopia, spices like Berbere carry tradition, memories, history
          and culture that have evolved over generations. These spices are
          sources of flavor and a reminder of the depth and richness of the
          history shared by all.

          It’s that history Fetlework Tefferi wanted to share when she opened
          Cafe Colucci, one of the first Ethiopian restaurants in Oakland,
          California, only to discover that she could not consistently source
          high quality, authentic ingredients because a robust supply chain
          didn’t exist.
